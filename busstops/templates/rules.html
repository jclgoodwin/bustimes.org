<h1>Vehicle editing rules</h1>

<p>Vehicle details (type, colour etc.) are user-editable.
    If you want to get involved, great! But please follow these rules, so you don’t waste your time and others’:</p>

<ol class="rules">
    <li>If a vehicle’s <strong>tracking as the wrong vehicle</strong>
        (i.e. the “ticket machine code” is wrong), please
        <strong>don’t try to correct it</strong> on bustimes.org
        – instead, wait for the operator to correct their data.
    </li>
    <li>Don’t “remove from list” just because a vehicle’s been advertised for sale, was involved in an accident, or hasn’t tracked for a while.</li>
    <li>Don’t update a vehicle’s livery until it’s finished being repainted <strong>and</strong> you can share some evidence.</li>
    <li>Edit sparingly – you don’t need to “tidy up” or make everything “consistent”.</li>
    <li><p>Do use the “summary” field to link to some evidence, such as a picture you’ve <a href="https://imgur.com/upload">uploaded to Imgur</a>.
    But please don’t link to private Facebook groups – private means we can’t see them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Do not edit to leave messages for other users or report mistracks.</li>
</ol>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>How do I add a vehicle?</h3>

<p>You can’t – the lists on bustimes.org are just a by-product of the <a href="/map">live bus tracker map</a>.
    Other websites like <a href="https://buslists.uk/">buslists.uk</a> are the future, and will always be more comprehensive.</p>

<h3>Can I use this data?</h3>

<p>Yes, it’s available <a href="/api/">in the API</a>. <a href="https://busmiles.uk/">Busmiles</a> is an example of a site that uses it.</p>

<h3>I have a different question, or maybe a comment</h3>

<p><a href="/contact">Ask me</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gY4PdDFau7">the Discord server</a>.</p>
