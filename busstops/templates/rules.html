<h1>Vehicle editing rules & FAQ</h1>

<ul class="bulleted">
<li>
    <p><strong>If in doubt, do nothing.</strong> If you find yourself saying "probably", "correct me if I'm wrong", or using the future tense, stop.
        However thrilling it may be to be the first to update this website with new information, be patient and wait until you can prove that (for example) a vehicle has been repainted.</p>

    <ul><li>
        <p>A link to a private Facebook page is <em>not</em> acceptable proof, and nor is blindly copying information from other "enthusiast websites".</p>
    </ul>

<li>
    <p>On the other hand: <strong>it's not your duty to enforce these rules</strong>. Don't be haughty or bumptious. If you can't prove they're wrong, <strong>don't undo someone else's changes</strong>. "Tidying up" isn't a thing – if anything, each edit creates more "mess" in the revision history.</p>

<li>
    <p><strong>Assume good faith.</strong> Before you accuse someone of "spam" or "vandalism", consider whether they've just made a mistake or are medically gormless. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

<li>
    <p>Don't try to use the <em>edit vehicle details</em> feature to "message" other users or "the admins". If you must, <a href="/contact">contact bustimes.org</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Why haven't you designed a perfect system for handling edits, voting, moderation etc?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately it's hard, and a distraction from the main job of making a bus tracking and timetable website. I'd quite like to get rid of the whole thing, but it would be a shame to toss away everyone's collective work.</p>

<h3>Can I become an admin?</h3>

<p>There's no such thing! You might as well ask how to become a mermaid.</p>

<h3>How do I add a vehicle?</h3>

<p>You can't. The vehicle lists on bustimes.org are purely a by-product of the automatic vehicle tracking system (the <a href="/map">live map</a> etc.). There are <a href="https://buslists.uk/">other fine websites</a> devoted to listing vehicles for the sake of it.</p>

<h3>I have a different question, or maybe a comment</h3>

<p><a href="/contact">Don't keep it to yourself</a></p>
