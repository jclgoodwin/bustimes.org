Using the “edit vehicle information” feature requires an email address, to facilitate logging in, and so that I can contact you if necessary. If you create an account and log in, I may also record your IP address, to help identify and prevent abuse and vandalism.

If you <a href="/contact">email me</a>, I ask for your name and email address, in order that I can reply. I may forward your message to e.g. a bus operating company or transport authority, if they are better placed to help you, unless you ask me not to.
